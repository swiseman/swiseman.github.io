I'm a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard, advised by [Stuart Shieber](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/) and [Sasha Rush](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~srush/). I'm a member of the [harvardnlp](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/papers/) group, and I'm interested in machine learning and natural language processing. Here's a link to my [CV](http://swiseman.github.io/files/swiseman_cv.pdf).
