#### Update: I am no longer an assistant professor at Duke (and am therefore no longer recruiting students). Details TK.

#### About me:
 I'm an assistant professor at [Duke University's](https://www.duke.edu) [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.duke.edu/), and I'm interested in natural language processing and machine learning. Before Duke, I was a research assistant professor at [TTIC](http://www.ttic.edu/), and before that a PhD student in Computer Science at [Harvard](https://www.seas.harvard.edu), where I was advised by [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) and [Stuart Shieber](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/).

Here's my [CV](http://swiseman.github.io/files/swiseman_cv.pdf).
