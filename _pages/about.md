**Update:** I'll be joining [Duke Computer Science](https://www.cs.duke.edu/) as an assistant professor in Fall 2021.

I'm a Research Assistant Professor at [TTIC](http://www.ttic.edu/), and I'm interested in natural language processing and machine learning.

Before TTIC I was a PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard and a member of the [harvardnlp](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/papers/) group; I was advised by [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) and [Stuart Shieber](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/shieber/).

Here's my [CV](http://swiseman.github.io/files/swiseman_cv.pdf).
